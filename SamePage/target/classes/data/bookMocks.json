    "summary": "And the Mountains Echoed is a deeply moving story about how we love, how we take care of one another and how the choices we make resonate through generations. With profound wisdom, depth, insight and compassion 'and moving from Kabul, to Paris, to San Francisco, to the Greek island of Tinos' Hosseini writes about the bonds that define us and shape our lives, the ways that we help our loved ones in need and how we are often surprised by the people closest to us. Six years in the writing, Khaled Hosseini says of his new book: 'My earlier novels were, at heart, tales of fatherhood and motherhood. My new novel is a multi-generational family story as well, this time revolving around brothers and sisters, and the ways in which they love, wound, betray, honour and sacrifice for each other.'",
